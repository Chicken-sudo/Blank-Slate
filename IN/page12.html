<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You read the patient’s note, hoping that something might jog your memory. The note’s contents echo through your mind.</p><p>
“Patient Diagnosis: Severe Burns, Name: Neil Amarion”</p><p>
Nothing. The name <em>Neil Amarion</em> does nothing to ease your mind, nothing even approaching the name finds its way into your memories. One thing that is certain is that this person’s wounds were burns, but that does little to alleviate your unease. This man is your only link to your lost memories and even the name is not leading you anywhere. The doctor could return any minute so you have to think fast, or else your memories might remain missing forever.
