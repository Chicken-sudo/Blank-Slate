<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	Despite the doctor’s wishes, you continue dancing. You break it down and bring it up and pop and lock and whatever dance moves you think you remember. The doctor exhaustedly calls security to stop you, but you know he just doesn’t understand. When security arrives you know you must do something drastic, nothing can stand between you and dance fever. You do the first thing that you can think of: <em>a Quadruple Leaping Pirouette</em>. To the shock and awe of everyone, most of all yourself, you execute it flawlessly.</p><p>
The security cheers as your dance moves are executed with grace exceeding the professionals. You know that whatever life you had before this moment no longer mattered, because you knew that dance was your passion. You dance your way out of the hospital, no one stops you. You decide to share your gift by becoming a famous dancer, it takes only a moment for the world to recognize your talent. You eventually start a dance class, so that others might follow in your footsteps. You don’t know who you were before the hospital, but the life of Blank the world-renowned dancer was one you could be proud of.
