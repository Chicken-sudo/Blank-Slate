<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You enter the opposite room, after all, entering another person’s private room is probably frowned upon. This new room is filled with books in every corner, you recognize that you become very curious about the contents of this library. Books are an endless font of wisdom, perhaps one of these books might jog your memories. Two specific books catch your eye, one book was a brilliant red embroidered with shining golden patterns, the other was a simple but expansive blue book sitting on the counter. You knew for certain that while the red book might hold something far more interesting, the blue book’s inconspicuous appearance hid a far more noble truth.
