<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You awake in a small room with nothing but a bed and a note beside it. The bed sinks as you adjust your position to glance at the note.</p>
<img src="p1Image.jpg">
<p>“Patient Diagnosis: Amnesia, Name: ________”</p>
<p>The name on the note was left blank, something told you that it was your name. Your name was Blank. Your mind wanders trying to recall anything before this moment, but your mind returns empty handed. A part of you loses all hope, wishing that you could sink back into your bed and allow the few memories you’ve gained to fade away back to blissful ignorance. How wonderful it was before you beheld your own misplaced mind. But another part awakes like a cornered dog, burning to discover what it is that you are missing.
