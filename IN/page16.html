<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	Of course! If anything was going to jog your memories it would be his face. You anxiously feel the bandages to find the end, and then begin to peel away at the face of your past. You think back to the note as the burns are slowly exposed by your delicate unwrapping. You try to think back to whatever it was that caused Neil’s burns and you think you remember the smell of something burning. Before you know it you’ve reached the final layer of bandages and prepare yourself. You uncover Neil’s face and…</p><p>
Nothing. Of course it’s nothing. Despite everything you still don’t recognize the man sitting before you. Your mind desperately tries to piece together what his face might have looked like before, but still nothing. You return to your room, your mind racing with questions that no longer held any answers. You were eventually allowed to leave, but you chose to remain in the hospital for the rest of your days. You never regained your memories. You are nothing more than a <em>Blank Slate.</em>.
