<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	The so-called friend lies motionless in front of you. Their chest rises and falls with infrequent breaths through the white bandages. The few parts of their body left unobscured by bandages and clothing are rough and blistered. They seem to be male, and his skin seems dark although you canâ€™t be certain because of the wounds. Looking at the miserable body brings no memories back, not even emotions arise from the sorry state of your friend. It is clear that the patient as he is will not jog your memory, you could wake him but that may make the injuries worse. You see that there is a note by the bed, similar to your own room.
