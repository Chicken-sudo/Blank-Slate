<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You search through the library and read through every book you can. You stay in the room for days reading dozens upon dozens of books, praying that one might hold the secret to your past. By the time you were halfway through the books, however, you didn’t remember why you started in the first place. You were happy to simply keep reading, to read anything you can. The staff of the hospital eventually grew annoyed with your constant presence in the library, but the books weren’t going to read themselves.</p><p>
Once you read the final book available you were certain you knew a lot, but not everything. You slam the book down and dash out of the hospital, shoving any staff or security that might get in your way. You were going to read everything, to know everything. You may not have memories of your life before the hospital, but you have the memories of a thousand more lives. You kept running, running for a longer time than you care to admit, but it was worth it. It was worth everything to know everything.
