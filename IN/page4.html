<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You wander through the hallways thinking to yourself. “Why was I brought here,” you thought. Perhaps you brought yourself here? As a million possibilities raced through your mind you found yourself at the end of the hallway. You look around and see two identical doors on either side of you. As you look around, a nurse pushes past you and rushes toward the door on your left. You realize that you’re not sure what nurses do, although you can’t tell if that is a result of amnesia or common ignorance. The nurse leaves the left room and walks past without a word, but while leaving the room ajar. Walking into another person’s room seems wrong, yet your intrigue entices you.
