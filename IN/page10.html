<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You open the book with great intensity and begin reading what seems to be the autobiographical works of an individual by the name of <em>Don Quixote</em>. The wording is difficult for you to understand, still you read intently through the man’s grand adventures and find yourself harboring a great envy of his bravery and chivalry. Before you know it hours have passed, but you find yourself no less invested. You feel honored with the knowledge of the Don’s bravery when fighting an army of four armed giants when a chill suddenly falls down your spine. You recognize that description as the beasts outside this room’s very window!
