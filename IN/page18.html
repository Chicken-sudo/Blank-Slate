<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	Despite every logical fiber of your being, you grab the bandaged patient and shake him like spray can. The patient wakes with jolt and a low groan. The equipment in the room begins to beep in an irregular pattern that leaves you concerned. Worried that your recklessness may have caused the patient some discomfort, you decide to examine his body. </p><p>
Pulling some equipment from the cabinet behind you, you manage to find an ear-cold-button-thing. As if it was second nature, you plug the device into your ears and place the cold-button-thing onto the patient’s chest. Hearing his rapid heartbeat you realize that he could be dying and decide to help yourself to the silver-paddle-things to try and fix your mistake. They don’t seem to help much until you plug them in, causing the patient to lurch. His heartbeat seems to normalize when the doctors dash into the room.</p><p>
You are locked in your room and not allowed to leave again, but you still find pride in managing to save someone’s life. You aren’t sure who you were before all of this, and you may never know, but you start to think that <em>Blank</em> would make a pretty good doctor.
