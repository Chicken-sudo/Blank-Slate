<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You bravely toss the book aside, itâ€™s not like it held any secrets to defeating the giants, the Don was too prideful to make it that easy. You leap through the window and land in some bushes at the base of the building. Your body aches but you know that the giants were capable of far worse. You picked up a mighty blade from the bushes and prepared for a mighty battle as you sprint toward the towering spectre of death. With every strike the giant beast still refuses to acknowledge you, you are sure to make it regret that decision.</p><p>
With your final mighty blow the wind grows still, and the giant creaks to a halt. As the giant lies still you are sure that your victory was well earned. You do not return to the hospital, such a quaint place unaware of its brush with death. You instead march toward the sunset, reassured in the knowledge that if any foe were to threaten the innocent you would be there. Just like your predecessor, you had become Blank the Brave Knight, savior of the innocent. You quite liked the sound of that.
