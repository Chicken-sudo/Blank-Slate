<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You dance with renewed vigor for the visitor. Your moves are still crude, but your mistakes are fewer and flourishes more extravagant. The man unfortunately does not seem amused by your improvement. “I’m sorry but I NEED you to stop that and take this seriously.” He raises his voice to speak above the tapping of your footsteps and seems increasingly upset by your attempts at a triple pirouette. “If you do not stop that I will be forced to call security, you are disturbing the patients.” His voice echoes a through the room and you recognize that what you think was dancing has worn out its welcome. Perhaps taking the man up on his offer would be the better choice.
