<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	The bed is surprisingly comfortable, with blankets that curl around your chest like a loving embrace. Your mind wanders again, and you remember what an embrace is, but you struggle to create an image of any potential embracer. The back of your head aches, as if screeching that finding the truth of your identity, finding your name and memories, is vital. Your head sinks deeper into the pillow and your eyes grow heavy but you know you must get up. Your body begs to leave the comfort of this bed and run, RUN toward any chance at obtaining any modicum of what you used to be.
