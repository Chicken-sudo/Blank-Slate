<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	Despite all logic telling you otherwise, you decide to remain in bed. You forget all your worries and go back to sleep, as if the note was just a bad dream. You sleep soundly, completely unaware of the issues of the outside world. You intended to sleep for only a few hours, but quickly realize that there isn’t much worth waking up for. Your rest is expanded to days, eventually weeks. Months pass before you finally wake up, completely refreshed. Apparently no one visited during your pseudo-coma, but that’s fine, they were missing out.</p><p>
The doctors dismiss you and send you to what they say is your home, but you don’t really think it’s worth the effort to check. You live the rest of your life in complete bliss, anyone would after getting a proper good-night’s sleep.
