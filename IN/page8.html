<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	This room is extremely similar to your own, however it had a table with a large red book on it. A patient lies on the bed, with bandages covering their entire face, and a blanket covering the rest of their body. No defining characteristics stand out to you. Glancing up from the patient you realize that a man is standing in the room writing something, he looks up and notices you too. “Ah, you’re awake. I’m afraid your friend still hasn’t woken up; you can stay if you like but please don’t touch any of the patient’s bandages.” You have no idea who this friend of yours is, but if they were with you before you arrived then they may know who you are.
