<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You begin dancing your heart out! You dance like you’ve never danced before, a class of dance that is quite hard on the eyes. After tripping over yourself a few times you manage to find a groove that your awkward movements are able to fit. After a few minutes you hear the door open and watch a man enter and look upon your silent movements with horror and confusion.</p><p>
“What are you doing?” he asks in the kindest tone he can possibly muster. “No matter, the important thing is that you seem to be awake. I am here to ask you some questions about the incident, and the person that was with you.” You interrupt your crude shuffling for a moment, he said that you came to this place with another person, but who? Would this mystery person know who you were? You knew you had to find out.
