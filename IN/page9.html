<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You open the blue book and are surprised to find that it is a self help book for reading comprehension. Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that it is unlikely that a book teaching how to read holds the secrets to your past, but you continue reading anyway. You apply the lessons taught by the book in order to get through the dry material but after several hours you reach the end. Now equipped with countless reading skills you are eager to put them to the test and begin looking through the library for novels that might finally give you an idea about your missing memories.
