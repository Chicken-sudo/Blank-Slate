<h1>Blank Slate</h1>
<p>	You pull yourself from the bed and get a good look at your surroundings. The room is quiet as you take in the air. A slight breeze comes from the window which appears to be only slightly ajar. The room has no decorations of any kind, but you are sure that you are in a hospital. You donâ€™t quite remember specifics, but you do recall that they are places for the sick. Perhaps your amnesia is what landed you here, or maybe it was an unfortunate side effect of a worse condition. You sigh in relief that the latter possibility, if true, seems to have passed. You have seen all that this room has to offer and prepare to remove yourself.
